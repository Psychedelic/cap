//! The SDK for integrating Certified Asset Provenance (CAP) into an Internet Computer canister.
//!
//! # ⚠️ **Currently the SDK is in version `1.0.0-alpha1`** ⚠️
//!
//! It does not support the full Cap specification, which may
//! cause panics if your canister is not updated when Cap is fully released.
//!
//! All methods which may suffer from issues are documented.
//!
//! # Additional Developer Resources
//! There are developer resources such as diagrams, additional
//! documentation, and examples in the [cap-sdk respository](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap/tree/cap-sdk/sdk).
//!
//! # ⚠️ Updating your canister ⚠️
//!
//! ⚠️ There is a specific flow you need to follow when upgrading
//! your canister that depends on Cap to ensure no Cap configuration
//! is lost accidentally.
//!
//! TODO, write example
