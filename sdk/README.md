<h3 align="center">Transaction history & asset provenance for NFT’s & Tokens on the Internet Computer</h3>

The CAP SDK is a development kit utilized to integrate CAP to Token/NFTs canisters and interact with the CAP open internet service in general.

**This is meant as an early look into how CAP is integrated/works**, and the code behind it. Visit the [src directory](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap/tree/cap-sdk/sdk/core/src) and read the `bucket.rs`, `index.rs`, `root.rs`, `router.rs` files for a quick overview.

This repository has the base codebase **(in development)**, for all the canisters involved in the CAP open internet service.

>**IMPORTANT:** CAP is currently in development 🚧 and will release in the first week of November, thus it is not on mainnet or usable yet. You might see our documentation is light on the SDK/Main repo still. We're delayed in this to focus on testing, but will soon update this page with guides & detailed examples for developers.
