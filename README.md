<h1 align="center">CAP - Certified Asset Provenance</h1>

<h3 align="center">Transaction history & asset provenance for NFT’s & Tokens on the Internet Computer</h3>

> CAP is an open internet service providing transaction history & asset provenance for NFT’s & Tokens on the Internet Computer. It solves the huge IC problem that assets don’t have native transaction history, and does so in a scalable, trustless and seamless way so any NFT/Token can integrate with one line of code.

This repository has the base codebase **(in development)**, for all the canisters involved in the CAP open internet service.

For integrations visit the [CAP-SDK repository](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap/tree/main/sdk) in the case of Tokens/NFTs wanting to integrate CAP to have a transaction history; and the [CAP-js repository](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cap-js/) for UIs that want to surface transaction history data for users from CAP.

>**IMPORTANT:** CAP is currently in development 🚧 and will release in the first week of November, thus it is not on mainnet or usable yet. You might see our documentation is light on the SDK/Main repo still. We're delayed in this to focus on testing, but will soon update this page with guides & detailed examples for developers.


## Canisters in CAP

This repository contains am implementation for the [spec](./spec.md) described for this OIS, which requires multiple canisters to act with each other, currently there are the following canisters:

1. **Router**: The router canister is the central canister for this service, it is the entry 
point.
2. **Root**: The root canister implements the `Root Bucket` interface of the spec.
3. **Bucket**: Implements an archive canister that is generated by the `Root Bucket`.
